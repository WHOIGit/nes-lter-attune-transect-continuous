These data represent the abundance, biovolume, and biomass of prokaryotic and eukaryotic picoplankton and nanoplankton sampled continuously underway during Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) Transect cruises, ongoing since 2018. Samples were obtained with an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer sampling at approximately 2-min intervals from the underway science seawater. Cells were identified and enumerated from the flow cytometry data files based on their scattering, phycoerythrin (575 nm) and chlorophyll (680 nm) fluorescence signals.
