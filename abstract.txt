These data represent the abundance, biovolume, and biomass of prokaryotic and eukaryotic picoplankton and nanoplankton sampled continuously underway during Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) Transect cruises, ongoing since 2018. Samples were obtained with an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer sampling at approximately 2-min intervals from the underway science seawater.
